                <h5 class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp animate__slow animate_delay-0.8s">I designed and completed this project of my own accord, outside of my education, out of my interest for Formula 1. In honesty, this project came about from equal parts interest in programming, and just wanting a quick way to find and display results from past F1 races. The <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2024/races">official Formula 1 website results page</a> is by no means bad, or difficult to use, however due to the way it is designed it requires some degree of clicking and selecting. I was curious about how a text-based interface would fare with this type of data, and so I wrote this program. Unfortunately the API this program uses is shutting down at some point in the near future, however it is still functional at time of writing.</h5>
