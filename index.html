                <h5 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRightBig animate__slow">My name is Euan, I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently studying a bachelors in Computing Science at the University of Dundee. I really enjoy programming and chose my degree specifically because I have had a long-standing interest in computing science and wish to work in this industry.<br><br>
                    
                Through school and university I have had a wide range of experience working with a number of different languages, including: Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and BASH. I have experience in scripting, programming, working with physical components (such as a Raspberry Pi), and user experience. I have worked on several projects, both in and out of education, summaries and code for which can be found below.<br><br>

                Outside of education and programming, I regularly play badminton, watch Formula 1, drive racing simulators, and listen to music.
