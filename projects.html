                <h5>Below are listed some of the university projects I have worked on, both solo and as part of a group. As these are university projects I cannot provide extensive detail, or code, however I have included them to help illustrate the experience I have with various languages.<br><br>
                
                - First Year
                <ul>
                    <li>Version control system (group work, written in BASH)</li>
                    <li>Basic bootstrap website (group work, written in html and css)</li>

                </ul>
                - Second Year
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect 4 bot, made using uninformed and informed AI search strategies (group work, written in Java)</li>
                    <li>Creating and editing adjacency matrices (solo work, written in C)</li>
                    <li>Car rental company software (solo work, written in C++)</li>

                    <li>NoSQL database (solo work, MongoDB)</li>
                    <li>Mock interface for a local art gallery (group work, made using figma)</li>
                    <li>Event planner, full stack web app (group work, written in: Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jinja)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Most of my first-year projects were focused around basic concepts and served to help set a solid base from which to build on. The Java work involved various list implementations and binary trees, with some of the later work I included GUIs (as an optional extra). The RPN calculator taught me string manipulation, as well as reading and validating user input. The Raspberry Pi project furthered some experience I had picked up from school, with regards to interfacing between a Python program and physical components.<br><br>
                The SQL, NoSQL, and CPU scheduling projects were geared towards demonstrating an underlying understanding, as oppposed to showing off skills in relation to a certain language. Both databases were fairly simple, the assignments were marked based on how we showed our knowledge of how to create, set up, and format different types of databases. The CPU scheduling simluator was also designed to demonstrate an understanding of different scheduling algorithms, as opposed to my Python skills. The car rental company software and adjacency matrices were showing both an understanding of concepts we had been looking at as well as the languages themselves. The event planner represents the largest and most complex project I have undertaken. We used a flask backend to route requests, we made a fully functioning login system that hashed a users' password to maintain security, I learnt how to use cookies to store API keys locally, allowing the backend to properly authenticate a user each time they made a new request, we used the flask backend and jinja to create reusable template pages that would change depending on the access level of the user logged in, and we used SQL databases to store user information and event information. The project took about 2-3 weeks to complete.
