                <h5 class="animate__animated animate__slideInUp animate__slow animate_delay-0.8s">This project was a first-year assignment I was given at university. I worked in a team, with 3 other people, to create an application that could mimic the functionality of a "snapchat" or "messenger"-like application. As we were only in first-year, there was no expectation to implement any kind of network support, or off-device copies of any data. Functionally, the application allowed the user to view previous conversations (which we generated), add messages to conversations, and start new conversations. None of these conversations had another user on the other end, nor was there any functionality allowing the user to "send" messages from the other side of the conversation (without entering the text file in which they were stored and manually editing the conversation).<br>This project provided invaluable experience in Java, user design, and working as part of a team. The rest of the team and I met to go over the design of the program, delegate code, and discuss functionality. Even whilst coding parts of the program, we regularly communciated about how we were implementing certain features, so that we could all have an up-to-date understanding of how the program worked, and how our individual sections of code would interact with each other. Ultimately the project was (in my opinion) successful, the application worked well and I achieved a grade A3 for my part in it.</h5>
                <h5><br>Unfortunately, as this is a university assignment I am unable to provide the code for it.</h5>
